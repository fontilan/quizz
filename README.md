Solo project of the Bob Ziroll's [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) Scrimba course.

I have also implemented a few additional features: 
- it looks good on smaller screens with answers stacking vertically
- more to come!

To do:
- check colors, aria labels etc for accessibility purposes
- add option to choose category
- add option to choose difficulty
- add option to choose a true-or-false questions
