Built from scratch as the final solo project of the [Bob Ziroll's Scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) based on a Figma design.

I have also implemented a few additional features: 
- an option to choose category
- an option to choose difficulty
- it looks good on smaller screens with answers stacking vertically
- the code has been refactored in accordance with the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide using ESLint
- some of the colors have been tweaked to improve contrast to help with accessibility

To do:
- (mobile) scroll to top when starting a new game
- add option to choose a true-or-false questions
- (maybe) add button to go back to Intro to select category and/or difficulty without refreshing the whole page
