Built from scratch as the final solo project of the [Bob Ziroll's Scrimba course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) based on a Figma design.

I have also implemented a few additional features: 
- [feat] option to choose category
- [feat] option to choose difficulty
- [feat] option to choose type of question
- [mobile] answers stacking vertically on small screens
- [mobile] scroll to top when starting a new game
- [code style] the code has been refactored in accordance with the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide using ESLint
- [a11y] some of the colors have been tweaked to improve contrast to help with accessibility


To do:
- some kind of message when trying to request nonexistent questions
- (maybe) add button to go back to Intro to select category and/or difficulty without refreshing the whole page
